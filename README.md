# 'Roni' for FitBit Versa

This is the code for the Roni watchface, currently available for:
- Versa
- Versa Lite
- Versa 2

*Versa 3 and Sense are both in progress*

---

To build locally, run *npm install* on the directory related to the OS version you wish to 
build.  The repository is broken up into 3 main directories:
- 4.2 - Code specific to older devices that still use FitBit OS 4.2
- 5.0 - Code specific to newer devices that run FitBit OS 5.0
- core - Code shared between all devices, where the bulk of the logic is housed

There is also a *package.json* file in the root, which at the time of writing this, only
contains *prettier*.
